Sprint 1: Problem Formulation
Business Intelligence Exam Project ‚Äì CPH Business 2025
1. Brainstorm
After reviewing publicly available datasets on Kaggle, we selected the Walmart Sales Forecasting dataset due to its real-world relevance and variety of features such as temperature, fuel prices, CPI, unemployment, and holiday indicators. This dataset is well-suited for exploring predictive modeling, segmentation, and descriptive analytics in a retail setting using Business Intelligence (BI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. It opens up opportunities to enhance sales planning, resource allocation, and marketing strategies.

2. Problem Statement & Annotation
Challenge:
We aim to address the challenge of predicting and understanding fluctuations in weekly retail sales across Walmart stores based on economic and environmental variables.

Why this is important:
Accurate sales forecasting is essential for inventory control, staffing, and marketing decisions. With rising operational costs and shifting consumer behavior, data-driven insights are more critical than ever in retail.

Expected Solution:
We will apply regression, clustering, classification, and descriptive statistical methods to analyze and model weekly sales performance. This includes identifying patterns, forecasting future sales, and segmenting store behavior profiles.

Positive Impact:
The results will enable store managers, analysts, and corporate strategists to make more informed decisions, reduce waste, improve promotions, and optimize customer satisfaction.

Research Questions & Hypotheses
üîπ RQ1 (Regression):
How do temperature, fuel prices, and unemployment affect weekly sales performance?
H: Weekly sales can be predicted using a multilinear regression model with temperature, fuel price, and unemployment as predictors.

üîπ RQ2 (Clustering):
What natural groupings of store sales patterns can be identified?
H: Clustering stores based on average weekly sales and economic context (fuel price, CPI, unemployment) will reveal distinct store behavior profiles (e.g. "holiday-sensitive stores", "price-sensitive stores").

üîπ RQ3 (Classification):
Can we classify whether a store‚Äôs weekly sales will be above or below average?
H: Weekly sales can be reliably categorized as ‚Äúhigh‚Äù or ‚Äúlow‚Äù using classification models with predictors like fuel price, CPI, unemployment, and holiday flags.

üîπ RQ4 (Descriptive Statistics):
What are the distribution patterns (mean, median, range, standard deviation) of weekly sales for holidays vs. non-holidays?
H: Holiday weeks show significantly higher variance in weekly sales compared to non-holiday weeks.
